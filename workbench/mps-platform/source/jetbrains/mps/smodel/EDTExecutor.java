/**
 * Thread-safe

 * Invokes read/write/command task asynchronously on the EDT thread. Literally the essence is in the {@code myTaskQueue}
 * field which contains all the tasks in the order of invocation {@link #scheduleTask(Task)} method
 * </p>
 * Manages the tasks queue; allowing concurrently to add new tasks and flushing the old ones.
 * <ol>
 * <li> Tasks might come from various threads, they are added to the *tasks queue*
 * <li> Every time the task is the first one in the queue the #flush is initiated.
 * <li> The flush procedure is executed asynchronously on the EDT
 * <li> We use  {@link TransactionGuardImpl#wrapLaterInvocation(Runnable, ModalityState)} hack to ensure task execution
 *      in EDT regardless of actual modality state
 * </ol>
 * Property: The order of execution is equal to the order of tasks' scheduling
