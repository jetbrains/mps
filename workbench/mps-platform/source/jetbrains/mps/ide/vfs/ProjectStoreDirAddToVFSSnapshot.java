/**
 * Essentially a workaround for MPSI-43.
 * The thing is that .mps folder is never accessed up to a certain moment (I do not know which exactly).
 * So despite that fsnotifier sends all the notifications (on Mac I see notifications for
 * the whole volume) and we rightfully mark the directory as dirty,
 * intellij RefreshSession simply ignores the notifications and skips the changed modules.xml,
 * so that the StandaloneMPSProject#loadState never gets to be executed.
 * Intellij IDEs do not tend to have that sort of problem due to file-based indexing which almost
 * always happens at the project loading. Since .idea is a part of the project tree, there are a number
 * of places which call VirtualFile#getChildren on .idea.
 * Though I am able to see a similar behavior with IDEA in 50% of cases, still a second alt-tab always causes a
 * refresh and the second module is loaded by IDEA.
 * The consequences are similar for all components which persist their state in the project store directory.
 *
 * The fix here is to markDirty with reloadChildren=true, I think that loading the children of .mps dir would be enough.
 * <p>
