/**
 * Class loading progress of each MPS-loadable module.
 * <p>
 * Module lifecycle:
 * At first the module is UNLOADED. It comes to repository and a call of {@link ClassLoaderManager#preLoadModules(Iterable, org.jetbrains.mps.openapi.util.ProgressMonitor)} happens.
 * Then we check whether the module's dependencies are valid to load (and some other conditions). If everything is okay then we send
 * broadcast notification to the clients of {@link DeployListener}.
 * The state of module is changed to LAZY_LOADED at that moment.
 * When the classes of module are requested [through #getClass(), #getOwnClass(), #getClassLoader()] methods,
 * the actual ClassLoader construction happens and then the module is marked as LOADED.
 * LAZY_LOADED state could not be skipped.
 * <p>
 * When #reloadModules happens, module ClassLoader's are unloaded and then preLoaded (!) again. [back to lazy state again]
 * <p>
 * So the state diagram looks like this:
 * UNLOADED -> LAZY_LOADED -> LOADED
 * LAZY_LOADED -> UNLOADED
 * LOADED -> UNLOADED
